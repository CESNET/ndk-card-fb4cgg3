# fb4CGg3@VU9P or fb2CGg3@VU9P for the NDK

This repository contains an extension of the Network Development Kit (NDK) to support the **Silicom fb4CGg3@VU9P** or **Silicom fb2CGg3@VU9P** FPGA card.
- The NDK allows users to quickly and easily develop new network applications based on FPGA acceleration cards.
- You can build the FPGA firmware for this card using the [NDK-APP-Minimal application](https://github.com/CESNET/ndk-app-minimal/). The NDK-APP-Minimal is a reference application based on the NDK.
- The [NDK-APP-Minimal documentation](https://cesnet.github.io/ndk-app-minimal/) lists steps for building the FPGA firmware, loading it into the FPGA card, and also using it in the chapter "How to start".
